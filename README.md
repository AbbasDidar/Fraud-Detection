# Fraud Detection in Health Insurance

This project focuses on developing and implementing techniques to detect fraud and irregularities in health insurance claims. By leveraging data analysis, machine learning, and domain knowledge, the project aims to enhance the integrity and efficiency of insurance processes.

## Objectives
- **Detect fraudulent claims**: Identify anomalies and suspicious patterns in health insurance data.
- **Reduce operational losses**: Help insurance companies minimize losses due to fraud.
- **Improve efficiency**: Automate the fraud detection process to save time and resources.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare raw data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the data using statistical and visualization techniques.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Train models to classify claims as fraudulent or genuine.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- **Visualization**: Provide interactive dashboards and visualizations for decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, etc.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly, Tableau (optional)

## Data
The project uses synthetic or anonymized health insurance claim datasets. These datasets include features such as:
- Claim Amount
- Policy Details
- Customer Demographics
- Claim History
- Medical Records (anonymized)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/insurance-fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd insurance-fraud-detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```
2. Train the machine learning models:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model performance:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```
4. Visualize the results using dashboards or plots:
   ```bash
   python visualize_results.py
   ```
